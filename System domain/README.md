# 1.1 System Domain
The domain of an airline booking system encompasses various key components. 
It involves the management of flights, including information about schedules, 
routes, and aircraft details. The system must provide real-time data on seat 
availability and allow users to make reservations and book seats for their chosen 
flights. User authentication and profile management are integral, 
accommodating passengers, travel agents, and airline staff with distinct levels of 
access. The system also incorporates secure payment processing, generating 
booking confirmations and electronic tickets upon successful transactions. 
Handling cancellations, modifications, and refunds in accordance with airline 
policies is crucial. Integration with external systems, such as global distribution 
systems (GDS), enhances the system's capabilities. Notification features keep 
users informed about flight status and changes through various channels. 
Security measures and compliance with aviation regulations ensure data 
protection. Additionally, the system may offer reporting and analytics 
functionalities to analyze booking trends, performance, and customer behavior. 
Addressing these aspects within the domain is essential for creating a 
comprehensive and effective airline booking system.
